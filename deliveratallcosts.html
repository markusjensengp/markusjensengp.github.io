                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Deliver At All Costs is a thrilling action game where destruction, absurdity and intrigue collide! I worked as a 
                    programming intern at Far Out Games, fixing various features and bugs.

            <h2 class="contribution-headline">My Contribution</h2>
            <p class="contribution-text">I joined Far Out Games as an intern during the last few months of development on this title.
                The main focus at this stage was on polishing the game, which involved fixing bugs and improving existing gameplay mechanics. 
                Even though I joined late in the project, I still had the chance to contribute with my ideas and improvements to the 
                project. I got to work on most of the game's core systems, both completing assigned tasks and suggesting improvements.</p>

        <section class="project-contributions">
            <h3 class="contribution-headline">Bug Fixing</h3>
            <p class="contribution-text">My assigned tasks were diverse and allowed me to work on most of the game's systems, learning 
                about the codebase and overall structure while contributing to the project and learning the engine. From this, I gained 
                valuable experience in both debugging and how to join a team effectively, as well as improving my problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p class="contribution-text">The bugs I worked on ranged from simple null reference exceptions, input handling issues, or sound 
                effect issues, to more complex problems like mission-related issues.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="project-contributions">
            <h3 class="contribution-headline">Feature Improvements</h3>
            <p class="contribution-text">A feature that I worked on was an obtainable upgrade to the player car, more specifically the jet 
                engine upgrade. This upgrade allowed players to boost their speed and fly through the streets. It was designed to 
                give the player a shorter boost of speed, but it was a slight issue with it.
                <img src="gifs/JetEngine.gif" alt="Jet Engine Upgrade" class="media-gif">
                <br>After playtesting the upgrade, I found that it was quite easy to use the boost in order to propell yourself upwards, 
                reaching places that were not intended to be reached. To fix this, I limit boost depending on the car's upwards angle, ensuring 
                that players could still use it to gain speed without flying into unintended areas.</p>
            <div class="code-section">
                <a id="snippet" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="snippet-content">View Snippet</a>
                <div class="snippet-content" id="snippet-content">
                    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
float scalar = Vector3.Dot(carForward.XZ().normalized, carForward);
m_playerCarRigidBody.AddForce(carForward * (m_power * falloff * scalar), ForceMode.Acceleration);
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="contribution-text">Another issue with this upgrade was the speed, it was simply too fast. So I was tasked with adding a 
                top speed without affecting the boost acceleration or duration. This was solved by adding a force that counteracted the boost 
                force when the car reached a certain speed.

            <h3 class="contribution-headline">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="contribution-text">This project was my first experience working on a professional project and it has been such a valuable
                experience for me. I had the opportunity to work with a team of great developers and learn from them. Things like how a professional
                or larger project can be structured, and the how game engine works since this was my first project using Unity. But I also had the 
                opportunity to contribute to the project with my own ideas and improvements, and got valuable feedback on my work which helped me greatly.
                <br>While getting into the project's structure and codebase, I also learned how to effectively join and navigate a larger project, and 
                how to adapt to the team's workflows and standards, which are great skills to have.
                <br>Working with Far Out Games has been a great experience and I am very grateful for the opportunity to work with them. And I have 
                grown both as a team member and as a programmer during this internship.
